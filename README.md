# Prelang Feedback
This repository is for reporting [Prelang](http://prelang.com) bugs and requesting features (as GitHub issues).

## Disclaimer
We get many, many feature requests and cannot promise to fulfill them all.  Additionally, **we're working a new supplementary product to the current Prelang Builder which is taking up most of development time** which is why Prelang Builder hasn't changed much (for now).

## Bugs
Check if the bug already exists in [the issues labeled *bug*](https://github.com/Prelang/feedback/labels/bug).

* If it does, add a "+1" comment (with or without additional information).
* If it doesn't, [open a new issue](https://github.com/Prelang/feedback/issues/new) and label it as `bug`.

## Feature Requests
Check if the feature request already exists in [the issues labeled *enhancement*](https://github.com/Prelang/feedback/labels/enhancement).
* If it does, add a "+1" comment (with or without additional information).
* If it doesn't, [open a new issue](https://github.com/Prelang/feedback/issues/new) and label it as `enhancement`.
